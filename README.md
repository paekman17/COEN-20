Arm Assembly &amp; Embedded Systems

Labs taken during Winter 2019 in ARM Cortex-M4

Lab 1: Convert signed and unsigned numbers between decimal and binary, using two's complement (in C).

Lab 2: Return numbers and other things from functions with parameters in Assembly.

Lab 3: Copy 512 bits using different types of LDR instructions.

Lab 4: Calculate a numerically accurate quotient for linear interpolation.

Lab 5: Create functions to copy and fill cells for a sliding puzzle game.

Lab 6: Implement two Assembly functions to store and retrieve individual bits within an array. First version is implemented without bit-banding or loops; second version uses bit-banding.

Lab 7: Multiply a constant by a specific number as efficiently as possible, minimizing the number of clock cycles and registers as much as possible.

Lab 8: Create a function that evaluates a polynomial with floating-point reals and another function that evaluates a polynomial with Q16 fixed-point reals.

Lab 9: Use SIMD and Saturating Functions to modify a picture; driver function provides picture and ability to modify RGB
